# Let's Eat

This app was created as our final project at Holberton Tulsa. We came up with every aspect of this app ourselves from brainstorming initial ideas to final app development. Our initial concept was "it's really dificult to decide what to have for dinner, especially in a group of 2 or more", so we created Let's Eat. It's an app that allows you to input prefernces for types of food (American, Asian, Mexican, BBQ, etc.) invite friends into a group and return a restaurant that gives the highest score between everyone in the group within a certain distance of the person who created the group. This can also be accomplished with one person only giving their preferences and finding a restaurant nearby that returns the highest score.You start with a login page where you can create a new account as long as it fits within certain criteria or log in using an existing google account. There's a friends list page where you can search and add friends. A settings page where you can input your location using City, State (long form or abbreviated), and zip code, as well as change your username. A homepage that displays your current entered location as well as intruction for the app how many friends you have and how many tables you are currently at. And a finally a table page that allows you to create a table with a name, invite any number of friends to that table, and then find what restaurant you will be attending in the future. We're very proud of this project and hope you enjoy using Let's Eat!
